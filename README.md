# Car Rental App(WORK IN PROGRESS)
I'm using this repository to study and practice commit pattern
The Car Rental App is a Node.js-based application using typescript designed to provide users with a seamless car rental experience, allowing them to rent cars and efficiently manage car-related operations.

## Car Rental App Architecture Explanation

The **Car Rental App** follows a modular and organized approach, emphasizing separation of concerns and encapsulation of functionalities. The architecture leverages the Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters Architecture) to achieve this goal.

### Hexagonal Architecture

The Hexagonal Architecture focuses on isolating the core business logic from external dependencies like frameworks, databases, and UI components. Key components include:

- **Core Business Logic**: The core of the application houses use cases and domain entities, free from technology-specific implementations.
- **Ports**: Interfaces that define interactions between the core and external components. Ports act as gateways for input and output.
- **Adapters**: Implementations of interfaces defined by ports. Adapters bridge the gap between the core and external resources.

This architecture enables enhanced modularity, testability, and maintainability.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd car-rental-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. The project supports Docker for containerization. Alternatively, you can run it locally with PostgreSQL. Note that while using Docker, if you have PGAdmin installed, you'll have to change the default port of Postgres

## Usage locally

1. Run the application: `npm start` (to run locally)
2. Access the app at: `http://localhost:3000`


## Usage with docker
1. [Docker Postgres Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)
   - This link takes you to the Docker Hub page for the official PostgreSQL Docker image.
   
2. [Docker Node Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/)
   - This link takes you to the Docker Hub page for the official Node.js Docker image.

1. After `npm install` be sure to have the PostgreSQL and Node images runing on docker
2. run `docker-compose build` to build the project in the containers
3. Run `docker-compose up` to run the project and it will be accessible at  `http://localhost:3000`


## API Endpoints

The application offers various API endpoints catering to different functionalities:

### Authentication

- `POST /sessions`: Authenticates a user and provides an authentication token.

### Categories

- `POST /categories`: Creates a new car category.
- `GET /categories`: Lists all available car categories.

### Specifications

- `POST /specifications`: Creates a new car specification (requires authentication WIP).

### Users

- `POST /users`: Registers a new user.
